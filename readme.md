# video-classification

Simple video classifier. Please modify [./pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) as needed. As it is currently on CPU mode.

<!-- TODO: Add links. -->
I'm using [nix]() for setting up the environment. And [poetry]() for package management.

To set up the lock files run:

```sh
nix develop .#poetry

poetry install
```

Then:

```sh
nix develop
```

To start the environment.
